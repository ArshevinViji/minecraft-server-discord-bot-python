# Overview
Do you want to be able to start a Minecraft server on your machine from a Discord bot? This simple script will help you do just that!

# Features
The commands `!start`and `!check` are available to use. They start and check the status of the server, respectively. 

# Installation
To get started, head over to the Discord Developer portal. Create an application and a bot. 
Now copy the bot's token into the line `token = ""`. For example, if your token is 12345, the line should look like `token = "12345"`
Next, go to your Minecraft server files. Copy the launch script's name and file extension (eg. run.bat) into the line `os.system(r"").`

Make sure the python script is in the same directory as your launch scripts.
