# Overview
Do you want a Discord Bot to start your Minecraft server? This program will help you do just that!

# Features
This script starts your Minecraft server and shuts it down too! It also shuts down the server when it's inactive. 

# Commands
There are 5 commands that can be used. 
1. `$start` will start the Minecraft server if it's not already running. 
2. `$stop` can be used to manually shut down the Minecraft server. However, it only shuts down if no players are online. 
3. `$check` will tell you whether the server is running. 
4. `$ip` will give you the server address. 
5. `$help` can be used to get information on these commands on Discord.
